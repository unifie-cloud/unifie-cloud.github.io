With Kubernetes and U-Store, an open-source solution designed to simplify cloud management, you can create a self-service SaaS platform in days, not months. In this guide, we\u2019ll walk through how to leverage U-Store and Kubernetes to launch your SaaS product efficiently.\\n\\n# Why Kubernetes for SaaS?\\n\\nKubernetes has become the gold standard for deploying cloud-native applications, and for good reason. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s ideal for SaaS platforms:\\n\\n- Multi-Tenant Isolation: Namespaces and resource quotas ensure tenant data remains isolated and secure.\\n- Scalability: Automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.\\n- Portability: Run your platform on AWS, GCP, Azure, or even on-premises infrastructure.\\n- Automation: Simplify deployments, updates, and rollbacks with Helm charts and GitOps workflows.\\n\\nBut managing Kubernetes for SaaS comes with challenges: self-service onboarding, billing, and customer-facing dashboards. That\u2019s where U-Store shines.\\n\\n# What is U-Store?\\n\\nU-Store is an open-source template that adds a self-service layer to Kubernetes, enabling you to build a branded SaaS platform where customers can deploy and manage their own instances. Think of it as the \\"Shopify for cloud deployments.\\"\\n\\n\ud83d\udd17 GitHub Repository: github.com/unifie-cloud/u-store\\n\\n### Key Features:\\n\\n- Self-Service UI: Customers sign up, deploy apps, and manage resources (e.g., version updates, password resets).\\n- Multi-Region Compliance: Let users choose deployment regions (e.g., US, EU) to meet data regulations.\\n- Stripe Integration: Handle subscriptions, payments, and billing automation.\\n- Customizable: Open-source codebase allows full UI/UX customization.\\n- Unifie Cloud Integration: Backend dashboard for DevOps teams to monitor deployments, debug issues, and manage Helm charts.\\n\\n# How to start\\n\\nSee these 4 lessons, in less than hour you will see the full step-by-step process\\n\\n- Lesson 1: Cluster creation https://youtu.be/B_mM74JDtsA\\n- Lesson 2: Deploying a Kubernetes Application https://youtu.be/2ojC8cLqpQM\\n- Lesson 3: Deploying Tianji from helm chart https://youtu.be/8ArGGmVJZn4\\n- Lesson 4: U-store usage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2SMceQucJg\\n\\n# Get Started Today!\\n\\nBuilding a SaaS platform with Kubernetes doesn\u2019t have to be a marathon.

However, since our team worked within the same time zone, these machines sat idle almost 16 hours per day, as most work was done during business hours. During the remaining 8 hours, the servers were often overloaded due to peak demand.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n# The Solution\\n\\nI migrated GitLab runners to Kubernetes. We already had a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS, so I configured Karpenter to handle autoscaling within the cluster.\\n\\nKarpenter uses taints and node affinity rules to determine on which nodes specific pods should run.\\n\\nThe configuration is set up so that Karpenter creates a node when a GitLab runner starts a pipeline. Then pipeline runs on a spot instance, specifically dedicated for CI/CD tasks. Our pipelines consume a significant amount of resources and can negatively impact other services if they share the same node in the cluster.\\n\\nOnce the pipeline completes, the node remains empty, thanks to the properly configured taints, which prevent other pods from being scheduled on it. After 30 minutes of inactivity, Karpenter automatically removes the node.\\n\\n# The Result\\n\\nBy migrating CI/CD pipelines to our Kubernetes cluster, we eliminated the need for three always-on virtual machines. Instead, we now run 1\u20132 spot nodes in the cluster, running ~60 hours per week, drastically cutting down our infrastructure costs.\\n\\nYou can get [configuration files in my github](https://github.com/VictorTrapenok/karpenter-for-gitlabrunner)\\n\\n- Helm chart for gitlab runner: [gitlab-runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner)\\n- karpenter autoscaller: [karpenter](https://karpenter.sh)\\n- karpenter configuration [karpenter-coniguration.yaml](https://github.com/VictorTrapenok/karpenter-for-gitlabrunner/blob/main/karpenter-coniguration.yaml)"}]}}')}}]);
